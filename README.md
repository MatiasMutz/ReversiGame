# ReversiGame

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the Reversi game in Python. The game is played in the console against the computer.
The computer uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move.

## How to play
To play the game, run the `othello.py` file. The game will start and you will be asked to choose the color of your pieces.
After that, you can make your moves by typing the coordinates of the cell you want to place your piece in. The
coordinates are in the format `row column`. For example, to place a piece in the top left corner, you would type `0 0`.
